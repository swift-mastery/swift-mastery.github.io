With Swift 5, the language is getting to a new level. Thanks to progressive disclosure, the
language is easy to get started with. It is now multi-platform and can run both on iOS devices, on MacOS,
but also on the server-side on Linux. However, the language is extremely dense and rich, as as you start
getting to more complex topics, it can become quite overwhelming.

To become proficient in Swift, you need to learn it from the ground up and deal with advanced topics,
one by one.

We are here to help you get a fastpath toward Swift mastery!

## Fast changing technology

Swift is a fast changing technology. Every year, Apple improves Swift in many ways and Swift has 
gone a very long way since Swift 1.0.

## Expand your horizon

Swift can now run on the server. There are many powerful frameworks available, all relying on the
powerful SwiftNIO library.

Each framework has its own feeling and making a choice can be difficult. Should you learn directly SwiftNIO?
Should you learn a high-level framework and which one? Is server-side Swift ready for production?

All those questions are answered in our training, with a path to get started quickly.

Out Swift server-side training can be especially good:
- If you are coming from a server-side background, using another technology, and would like to
  learn Swift in a familiar environment. Once you have some experience on Swift on the server,
  you will be able to expand your horizon to Swift client-side development.
- If you have a significant experience on the client using Objective C or Swift and would like
  to expand your skills to the server-side, to build applications using a *fullstack* approach.
